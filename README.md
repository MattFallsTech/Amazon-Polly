<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First I am going to be creating a IAM role with the suitable policies attached to it. I went to the create IAM role section, chose AWS service and selected Lambda as the use case.  <br/>

<br />
Next I added permissions from the list that will be needed for this project (AmazonPollyFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess and AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole) and gave a role name.   <br/>

<br />
Next I went S3 bucket to create and configure the bucket I will be using. I gave the backet a name and kept the rest of the options as default.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next I started creating the Lambda function by going to the Lambda page and clicking on create a function. I gave an appropriate name and set the runtime to Node.js 16.x. In the change default configuration role I checked the "Use an existing role" and selected the role I previously created. <br/>
